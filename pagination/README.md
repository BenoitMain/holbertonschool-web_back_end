# 🚀 REST API Pagination & HATEOAS Project

## 📖 Description

This project will help you master key techniques for paginating data in a REST API, including:

- 🔢 Simple pagination using `page` and `page_size` parameters.
- 🌐 Pagination with hypermedia metadata following the **HATEOAS** principle.
- 🛡️ Deletion-resilient pagination to handle data changes gracefully.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to confidently explain (without Googling):

- 📄 How to paginate a dataset with basic `page` and `page_size` parameters.
- 🔗 How to implement pagination enriched with hypermedia metadata so your API is self-descriptive.
- 🔄 How to paginate data in a way that stays consistent even if some items are deleted.
